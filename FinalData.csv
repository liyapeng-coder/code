The channel is also permeable to urea (PubMed:9405233). Plays an important role in body energy homeostasis under conditions that promote lipid catabolism, giving rise to glycerol and free fatty acids. Mediates glycerol export from adipocytes. After release into the blood stream, glycerol is used for gluconeogenesis in the liver to maintain normal blood glucose levels and prevent fasting hypoglycemia. Required for normal glycerol reabsorption in the kidney (By similarity)."

As acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are products of cholesterol catabolism and the nat gene is likely present in the same operon than genes involved in cholesterol degradation, this enzyme could have a role in the utilization and regulation of these CoA species (PubMed:19014350)."

Could also catalyze the hydrolysis of some nucleoside diphosphate derivatives (PubMed:22556419, PubMed:26238318). Hydrolyzes oxidized nucleosides triphosphates like 8-oxo-dGTP in vitro, but the specificity and efficiency towards these substrates are low. Therefore, the potential in vivo sanitizing role of this enzyme, that would consist in removing oxidatively damaged forms of nucleosides to prevent their incorporation into DNA, is unclear (PubMed:26238318, PubMed:22556419). Through the hydrolysis of thioguanosine triphosphates may participate in the catabolism of thiopurine drugs (PubMed:26238318, PubMed:25108385). May also have a role in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression by stabilizing PCNA (PubMed:19419956)."

R-type calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group and are blocked by nickel, and partially by omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to dihydropyridines (DHP), omega-conotoxin-GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA), and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA).

Lamotrigine,Lamotrigine,Voltage-dependent R-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1E,"Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1E gives rise to R-type calcium currents. R-type calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group and are blocked by nickel, and partially by omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to dihydropyridines (DHP), omega-conotoxin-GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA), and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA). Calcium channels containing alpha-1E subunit could be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing."

Estradiol,Estradiol,ATP synthase subunit a,"Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Key component of the proton channel; it may play a direct role in the translocation of protons across the membrane."
Estradiol,Estradiol,Beclin-1,"Plays a central role in autophagy (PubMed:23184933). Acts as core subunit of the PI3K complex that mediates formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; different complex forms are believed to play a role in multiple membrane trafficking pathways: PI3KC3-C1 is involved in initiation of autophagosomes and PI3KC3-C2 in maturation of autophagosomes and endocytosis. Involved in regulation of degradative endocytic trafficking and required for the abcission step in cytokinesis, probably in the context of PI3KC3-C2 (PubMed:20643123, PubMed:20208530). Essential for the formation of PI3KC3-C2 but not PI3KC3-C1 PI3K complex forms. Involved in endocytosis (PubMed:25275521). Protects against infection by a neurovirulent strain of Sindbis virus (PubMed:9765397). May play a role in antiviral host defense."

Regulates T-cell receptor alpha enhancer function. Binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. PIAG antagonizes both Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent activation by LEF1 (By similarity). Isoform 3 lacks the CTNNB1 interaction domain and may be an antagonist for Wnt signaling. Isoform 5 transcriptionally activates the fibronectin promoter, binds to and represses transcription from the E-cadherin promoter in a CTNNB1-independent manner, and is involved in reducing cellular aggregation and increasing cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Isoform 1 transcriptionally activates MYC and CCND1 expression and enhances proliferation of pancreatic tumor cells."

Has to be loaded onto DNA in order to be able to stimulate APEX2. Plays a key role in DNA damage response (DDR) by being conveniently positioned at the replication fork to coordinate DNA replication with DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance pathways (PubMed:24939902). Acts as a loading platform to recruit DDR proteins that allow completion of DNA replication after DNA damage and promote postreplication repair: Monoubiquitinated PCNA leads to recruitment of translesion (TLS) polymerases, while 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA is involved in error-free pathway and employs recombination mechanisms to synthesize across the lesion."

Catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of the double bond of 2-trans-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein], an essential step in the fatty acid elongation cycle of the FAS-II pathway (PubMed:7599116). Shows preference for long-chain fatty acyl thioester substrates (&gt;C16), and can also use 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs as alternative substrates (PubMed:7599116). The mycobacterial FAS-II system utilizes the products of the FAS-I system as primers to extend fatty acyl chain lengths up to C56, forming the meromycolate chain that serves as the precursor for final mycolic acids (PubMed:25227413)."

It thereby plays a central role in cadiomyocytes, neurons from entorhinal cortex, dorsal root and vomeronasal neurons, endocrine pancreas cells, kidney epithelial cells, cochlea hair cells etc. Participates in T-cell activation by modulating Ca(2+) oscillations after T lymphocyte activation, which is required for NFAT-dependent IL2 production. Involved in myogenic constriction of cerebral arteries. Controls insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. May also be involved in pacemaking or could cause irregular electrical activity under conditions of Ca(2+) overload. Affects T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell motility and cytokine production through differential regulation of calcium signaling and NFATC1 localization.

Plays a role in blood pressure regulation through regulation of intracellular calcium concentration and nitric oxide production leading to regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells vasoconstriction. Positively regulates bone mineralization through absorption of calcium from the intestine. Plays dual roles in osteoclast differentiation and survival by regulating RANKL-induced calcium oscillations in preosteoclasts and mediating calcium extrusion in mature osteoclasts (By similarity). Regulates insulin sensitivity through calcium/calmodulin signaling pathway by regulating AKT1 activation and NOS3 activation in endothelial cells (PubMed:29104511).

Functions in the nuclear localization and assembly of cyclin D-CDK4 complex and promotes its kinase activity towards RB1. At higher stoichiometric ratios, inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Inhibits DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase delta by competing with POLD3 for PCNA binding (PubMed:11595739)."

Arsenictrioxide,Arsenic trioxide,Protein PML,"Functions via its association with PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in a wide range of important cellular processes, including tumor suppression, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, senescence, DNA damage response, and viral defense mechanisms. Acts as the scaffold of PML-NBs allowing other proteins to shuttle in and out, a process which is regulated by SUMO-mediated modifications and interactions. Isoform PML-4 has a multifaceted role in the regulation of apoptosis and growth suppression: activates RB1 and inhibits AKT1 via interactions with PP1 and PP2A phosphatases respectively, negatively affects the PI3K pathway by inhibiting MTOR and activating PTEN, and positively regulates p53/TP53 by acting at different levels (by promoting its acetylation and phosphorylation and by inhibiting its MDM2-dependent degradation). Isoform PML-4 also: acts as a transcriptional repressor of TBX2 during cellular senescence and the repression is dependent on a functional RBL2/E2F4 repressor complex, regulates double-strand break repair in gamma-irradiation-induced DNA damage responses via its interaction with WRN, acts as a negative regulator of telomerase by interacting with TERT, and regulates PER2 nuclear localization and circadian function. Isoform PML-6 inhibits specifically the activity of the tetrameric form of PKM. The nuclear isoforms (isoform PML-1, isoform PML-2, isoform PML-3, isoform PML-4 and isoform PML-5) in concert with SATB1 are involved in local chromatin-loop remodeling and gene expression regulation at the MHC-I locus. Isoform PML-2 is required for efficient IFN-gamma induced MHC II gene transcription via regulation of CIITA. Cytoplasmic PML is involved in the regulation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. PML also regulates transcription activity of ELF4 and can act as an important mediator for TNF-alpha- and IFN-alpha-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell network formation and migration."

Induces gene expression by binding as monomers to the NR4A1 response element (NBRE) 5'-AAAAGGTCA-3' site and as homodimers to the Nur response element (NurRE) site in the promoter of their regulated target genes (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of proliferation, survival and differentiation of many different cell types and also in metabolism and inflammation. Mediates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, myeloid progenitor cell and type B pancreatic cells; promotes mitogen-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through transactivation of SKP2 promoter by binding a NBRE site (By similarity). Upon PDGF stimulation, stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by regulating CCND1 and CCND2 expression. In islets, induces type B pancreatic cell proliferation through up-regulation of genes that activate cell cycle, as well as genes that cause degradation of the CDKN1A (By similarity). Negatively regulates myeloid progenitor cell proliferation by repressing RUNX1 in a NBRE site-independent manner. During inner ear, plays a role as a key mediator of the proliferative growth phase of semicircular canal development (By similarity). Mediates also survival of neuron and smooth muscle cells; mediates CREB-induced neuronal survival, and during hippocampus development, plays a critical role in pyramidal cell survival and axonal guidance. Is required for S phase entry of the cell cycle and survival of smooth muscle cells by inducing CCND1, resulting in RB1 phosphorylation. Binds to NBRE motif in CCND1 promoter, resulting in the activation of the promoter and CCND1 transcription (By similarity). Plays also a role in inflammation; upon TNF stimulation, mediates monocyte adhesion by inducing the expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 by binding to the NBRE consensus site (By similarity) (PubMed:20558821). In mast cells activated by Fc-epsilon receptor cross-linking, promotes the synthesis and release of cytokines but impairs events leading to degranulation (By similarity). Plays also a role in metabolism; by modulating feeding behavior; and by playing a role in energy balance by inhibiting the glucocorticoid-induced orexigenic neuropeptides AGRP expression, at least in part by forming a complex with activated NR3C1 on the AGRP- glucocorticoid response element (GRE), and thus weakening the DNA binding activity of NR3C1. Upon catecholamines stimulation, regulates gene expression that controls oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle (By similarity). Plays a role in glucose transport by regulating translocation of the SLC2A4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (PubMed:24022864). Finally, during gastrulation plays a crucial role in the formation of anterior mesoderm by controlling cell migration. Inhibits adipogenesis (By similarity). Also participates in cardiac hypertrophy by activating PARP1 (By similarity)."

Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. KCNJ14 gives rise to low-conductance channels with a low affinity to the channel blockers Barium and Cesium (By similarity)."

Cannabidiol,Cannabidiol,Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 3,Calcium channel activity
Cannabidiol,Cannabidiol,Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4,"Non-selective calcium permeant cation channel involved in osmotic sensitivity and mechanosensitivity. Activation by exposure to hypotonicity within the physiological range exhibits an outward rectification (PubMed:18826956, PubMed:18695040). Also activated by heat, low pH, citrate and phorbol esters (PubMed:18826956, PubMed:18695040). Increase of intracellular Ca(2+) potentiates currents. Channel activity seems to be regulated by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism with a negative feedback mechanism (PubMed:12724311, PubMed:18826956). Promotes cell-cell junction formation in skin keratinocytes and plays an important role in the formation and/or maintenance of functional intercellular barriers (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) in synoviocytes (PubMed:19759329). Plays an obligatory role as a molecular component in the nonselective cation channel activation induced by 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate and hypotonic stimulation in synoviocytes and also regulates production of IL-8 (PubMed:19759329). Together with PKD2, forms mechano- and thermosensitive channels in cilium (PubMed:18695040). Negatively regulates expression of PPARGC1A, UCP1, oxidative metabolism and respiration in adipocytes (By similarity). Regulates expression of chemokines and cytokines related to proinflammatory pathway in adipocytes (By similarity). Together with AQP5, controls regulatory volume decrease in salivary epithelial cells (By similarity). Required for normal development and maintenance of bone and cartilage (PubMed:26249260)."

The hnRNP particle arrangement on nascent hnRNA is non-random and sequence-dependent and serves to condense and stabilize the transcripts and minimize tangling and knotting. Packaging plays a role in various processes such as transcription, pre-mRNA processing, RNA nuclear export, subcellular location, mRNA translation and stability of mature mRNAs (PubMed:19099192). Forms hnRNP particles with at least 20 other different hnRNP and heterogeneous nuclear RNA in the nucleus. Involved in transport of specific mRNAs to the cytoplasm in oligodendrocytes and neurons: acts by specifically recognizing and binding the A2RE (21 nucleotide hnRNP A2 response element) or the A2RE11 (derivative 11 nucleotide oligonucleotide) sequence motifs present on some mRNAs, and promotes their transport to the cytoplasm (PubMed:10567417). Specifically binds single-stranded telomeric DNA sequences, protecting telomeric DNA repeat against endonuclease digestion (By similarity). Also binds other RNA molecules, such as primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs): acts as a nuclear 'reader' of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mark by specifically recognizing and binding a subset of nuclear m6A-containing pri-miRNAs. Binding to m6A-containing pri-miRNAs promotes pri-miRNA processing by enhancing binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNA transcripts (PubMed:26321680). Involved in miRNA sorting into exosomes following sumoylation, possibly by binding (m6A)-containing pre-miRNAs (PubMed:24356509).

Each of the RNA-binding domains specifically can bind solely to a single-stranded non-monotonous 5'-UUAG-3' sequence and also weaker to the single-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' telomeric DNA repeat. Binds RNA oligonucleotides with 5'-UUAGGG-3' repeats more tightly than the telomeric single-stranded DNA 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats. Binding of RRM1 to DNA inhibits the formation of DNA quadruplex structure which may play a role in telomere elongation. May be involved in translationally coupled mRNA turnover. Implicated with other RNA-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic deadenylation/translational and decay interplay of the FOS mRNA mediated by the major coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD) domain.

Plays an important role in p53/TP53 response to DNA damage, acting at the level of both transcription activation and repression. When sumoylated, acts as a transcriptional coactivator of p53/TP53, playing a role in p21/CDKN1A and 14-3-3 sigma/SFN induction (By similarity). As far as transcription repression is concerned, acts by interacting with long intergenic RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21), a non-coding RNA induced by p53/TP53.

Artenimol,Artenimol,"Splicing factor, proline- and glutamine-rich","DNA- and RNA binding protein, involved in several nuclear processes. Essential pre-mRNA splicing factor required early in spliceosome formation and for splicing catalytic step II, probably as a heteromer with NONO. Binds to pre-mRNA in spliceosome C complex, and specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts. Involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing. During splicing of PTPRC/CD45, a phosphorylated form is sequestered by THRAP3 from the pre-mRNA in resting T-cells; T-cell activation and subsequent reduced phosphorylation is proposed to lead to release from THRAP3 allowing binding to pre-mRNA splicing regulatotry elements which represses exon inclusion. Interacts with U5 snRNA, probably by binding to a purine-rich sequence located on the 3' side of U5 snRNA stem 1b. May be involved in a pre-mRNA coupled splicing and polyadenylation process as component of a snRNP-free complex with SNRPA/U1A. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs. SFPQ may be involved in homologous DNA pairing; in vitro, promotes the invasion of ssDNA between a duplex DNA and produces a D-loop formation. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA unwinding by modulating the function of topoisomerase I/TOP1; in vitro, stimulates dissociation of TOP1 from DNA after cleavage and enhances its jumping between separate DNA helices. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer binds DNA (PubMed:25765647). The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination and may stabilize paired DNA ends; in vitro, the complex strongly stimulates DNA end joining, binds directly to the DNA substrates and cooperates with the Ku70/G22P1-Ku80/XRCC5 (Ku) dimer to establish a functional preligation complex. SFPQ is involved in transcriptional regulation. Functions as transcriptional activator (PubMed:25765647). Transcriptional repression is mediated by an interaction of SFPQ with SIN3A and subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional avtivity. SFPQ isoform Long binds to the DNA binding domains (DBD) of nuclear hormone receptors, like RXRA and probably THRA, and acts as transcriptional corepressor in absence of hormone ligands. Binds the DNA sequence 5'-CTGAGTC-3' in the insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE) and inhibits IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

Artenimol,Artenimol,Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5,"Involved in the alternative regulation of pre-mRNA splicing; its RNA helicase activity is necessary for increasing tau exon 10 inclusion and occurs in a RBM4-dependent manner. Binds to the tau pre-mRNA in the stem-loop region downstream of exon 10. The rate of ATP hydrolysis is highly stimulated by single-stranded RNA. Involved in transcriptional regulation; the function is independent of the RNA helicase activity. Transcriptional coactivator for androgen receptor AR but probably not ESR1. Synergizes with DDX17 and SRA1 RNA to activate MYOD1 transcriptional activity and involved in skeletal muscle differentiation. Transcriptional coactivator for p53/TP53 and involved in p53/TP53 transcriptional response to DNA damage and p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis. Transcriptional coactivator for RUNX2 and involved in regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Acts as transcriptional repressor in a promoter-specific manner; the function probably involves association with histone deacetylases, such as HDAC1. As component of a large PER complex is involved in the inhibition of 3' transcriptional termination of circadian target genes such as PER1 and NR1D1 and the control of the circadian rhythms."

In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. With PARP1 and EEF1A1, TXK forms a complex that acts as a T-helper 1 (Th1) cell-specific transcription factor and binds the promoter of IFNG to directly regulate its transcription, and is thus involved importantly in Th1 cytokine production. Phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1. Phosphorylates also key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2.

Following activation of viral RNA sensors, such as RIG-I-like receptors, associates with DDX3X and phosphorylates interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), IRF3 and IRF7, as well as DDX3X. This activity allows subsequent homodimerization and nuclear translocation of the IRF3 leading to transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes including IFNB. In order to establish such an antiviral state, IKBKE forms several different complexes whose composition depends on the type of cell and cellular stimuli.
